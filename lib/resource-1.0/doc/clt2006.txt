#NEW

==Purpose==

===Library for applications===

High-level access to grammatical rules

E.g. //You have k new messages// rendered in ten languages //X//
```
  render X (Have (You (Number (k (New Message)))))
```

Usability for different purposes
- translation systems
- software localization
- dialogue systems
- language teaching


#NEW

===Grammar as parser===

Often in NLP, a grammar is just high-level code for a parser.

But writing a grammar can be inadequate for parsing:
- too much manual work
- too inefficient
- not robust
- too ambiguous


Moreover, a grammar fine-tuned for parsing may not be reusable
- for generation
- for specialized grammars
- as library


#NEW

===Grammar as language definition===

Linguistic ontology: **abstract syntax**

E.g. adjectival modification
```
  AdjCN : AP -> CN -> CN ;
```

Rendering in different languages: **concrete syntax**

Resource grammars have generation perspective, rather than parsing
- abstract syntax serves as a key to expressions in different languages



#NEW

===Usability by non-linguists===

Division of labour: resource grammars hide linguistic details

Presentation: "school grammar" concepts, dictionary-like conventions

API = Application Programmer's Interface

Documentation: ``gfdoc``

IDE = Interactive Development Environment (forthcoming)

Example-based grammar writing
```
  render Ita (parse Eng "you have k messages")
```


#NEW

===Scientific interest===

Linguistics
- definition of linguistic ontology
- coping with different problems in different languages
- sharing concrete-syntax code between languages
- creating a resource for other NLP applications


Computer science
- datastructures for grammar rules
- type systems for grammars
- algorithms: parsing, generation, grammar compilation
- domain-specific programming language (GF)
- module system

==Coverage==

===Languages===

The current GF Resource Project covers ten languages:
- ``Dan``ish
- ``Eng``lish
- ``Fin``nish
- ``Fre``nch
- ``Ger``man
- ``Ita``lian
- ``Nor``wegian (bokmål)
- ``Rus``sian
- ``Spa``nish
- ``Swe``dish


In addition, parts (morphology) of Arabic, Estonian, Latin, and Urdu

API 1.0 not yet implemented for Danish and Russian



#NEW

===Morphology and lexicon===

Complete inflection engine
- all word classes
- all forms
- all inflectional paradigms


Basic lexicon
- 100 structural words
- 350 content words, mainly for testing
- these include the 207 [Swadesh words http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Swadesh_List]


It is more important to enable lexicon extensions than to 
provide a huge lexicon.
- technical lexica can have very special words, which tend to be regular





#NEW

===Syntactic structures===

Texts: 
sequences of phrases with punctuation

Phrases: 
declaratives, questions, imperatives, vocatives

Tense, mood, and polarity: 
present, past, future, conditional ; similtaneous, anterior ; positive, negative

Questions: 
yes-no, "wh" ; direct, indirect

Clauses: 
main, relative, embedded (subject, object, adverbial)

Verb phrases: 
intransitive, transitive, ditransitive, prepositional

Noun phrases: 
proper names, pronouns, determiners, possessives, cardinals and ordinals




#NEW

===Quantitative measures===

67 categories

150 abstract syntax combination rules

100 structural words

===Language-dependent paradigm modules===

====Regular paradigms====

Every language implements these regular patterns that take
"dictionary forms" as arguments.
```
  regN : Str -> N
  regA : Str -> A 
  regV : Str -> V
```
Their usefulness varies. For instance, they
all are quite good in Finnish and English.
In Swedish, less so:
```
  regN "val" ---> val, valen, valar, valarna
```
Initializing a lexicon with ``regX``s is
usually a good starting point in grammar development.


#NEW

====Regular paradigms====

In Swedish, giving the gender of ``N`` improves a lot
```
  regGenN "val" neutrum ---> val, valet, val, valen
```

There are also special constructs taking other forms:
```
  mk2N : (nyckel,nycklar : Str) -> N
  mk1N : (bilarna : Str) -> N

  irregV : (dricka, drack, druckit : Str) -> V
```

Regular verbs are actually implemented the 
[Lexin http://lexin.nada.kth.se/sve-sve.shtml] way
```
  regV : (talar : Str) -> N
```


#NEW

====Worst-case paradigms====

To cover all situations, worst-case paradigms are given. E.g. Swedish
```
  mkN : (apa,apan,apor,aporna : Str) -> N
  mkA : (liten, litet, lilla, sma, mindre, minst, minsta : Str) -> A
  mkV : (supa,super,sup,söp,supit,supen : Str) -> V
```


#NEW

====Irregular words====

Iregular words in ``IrregX``, e.g. Swedish:
```
    draga_V : V = 
      mkV (variants { "dra"; "draga"}) (variants { "drar" ; "drager"}) 
          (variants { "dra" ; "drag" }) "drog" "dragit" "dragen" ;
```
Goal: eliminate the user's need of worst-case functions.

===Compiling===

It is a good idea to compile the library, so that it can be opened faster
```
  GF/lib/resource-1.0% make

  writes GF/lib/alltenses
         GF/lib/present
         GF/lib/resource-1.0/langs.gfcm
```
If you don't intend to change the library, you never need to process the source
files again. Just do some of
```
  gf -nocf langs.gfcm                                    -- all 8 languages
 
  gf -nocf -path=alltenses:prelude alltenses/LangSwe.gfc -- Swedish only

  gf -nocf -path=alltenses:prelude present/LangSwe.gfc   -- Swedish only, present tense only
```


#NEW

===Parsing===

The default parser does not work!

The MCFG parser works in some languages, after waiting appr. 20 seconds
```
  p -mcfg -lang=LangEng -cat=S "I would see her"

  p -mcfg -lang=LangSwe -cat=S "jag skulle se henne"

  p -mcfg -lang=LangNor -cat=S "jeg ville se henne"

```
Parsing in ``present/`` versions is quicker.


#NEW

===Treebank generation===

Multilingual treebank entry = tree + linearizations

Some examples on treebank generation, assuming ``langs.gfcm``
```
  gr -cat=S   -number=10 -cf | tb                  -- 10 random S

  gt -cat=Phr -depth=4       | tb -xml | wf ex.xml -- all Phr to depth 4, into file ex.xml
```
Regression testing
```
  rf ex.xml | tb -c      -- read treebank from file and compare to present grammars 
```
Updating a treebank
```
  rf old.xml | tb -trees | tb -xml | wf new.xml    -- read old from file, write new to file
```



#NEW

===Treebank-based parsing===

Brute-force method that helps if real parsing is more expensive.
```
  make treebank                     -- make treebank with all languages

  gf -treebank langs.xml            -- start GF by reading the treebank

  > ut -strings -treebank=LangIta   -- show all Ita strings

  > ut -treebank=LangIta -raw "Quello non si romperebbe" -- look up a string

  > i -nocf langs.gfcm              -- read grammar to be able to linearize

  > ut -treebank=LangIta "Quello non si romperebbe" | l -multi  -- translate to all
```


#NEW

===Morphology===

Use morphological analyser
```
  gf -nocf -retain -path=alltenses:prelude alltenses/LangSwe.gf
  > ma "jag kan inte höra vad du säger"
```

Try out a morphology quiz
```
  > mq -cat=V
```

Try out inflection patterns
```
  gf -retain -path=alltenses:prelude alltenses/ParadigmsSwe.gfr
  > cc regV "lyser"
```
