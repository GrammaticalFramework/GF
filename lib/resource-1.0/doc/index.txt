The GF Resource Grammar Library defines the basic grammar of
ten languages: 
Danish, English, Finnish, French, German,
Italian, Norwegian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish.
Still incomplete implementations for Arabic and Catalan are also
included.

**New in Version 1.2**
- Simpler APIs using overloading: see [Synopsis synopsis.html].
  The API of version 1.0 remains valid and can be used in combination with this.
- Bug fixes and new paradigms.
- Licensed under LGPL.

==License==

The GF Resource Grammar Library is open-source software licensed under
GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). See the file [LICENSE ../LICENSE] for more
details.


==Scope==

Coverage, for each language:
- complete morphology
- lexicon of the ca. 100 most important structural words
- test lexicon of ca. 300 content words (rough equivalents in each language)
- list of irregular verbs (separately for each language)
- representative fragment of syntax (cf. CLE (Core Language Engine))
- rather flat semantics (cf. Quasi-Logical Form of CLE)


Organization:
- top-level (API) modules
- Ground API + special-purpose APIs
- "school grammar" concepts rather than advanced linguistic theory


Presentation:
- tool ``gfdoc`` for generating HTML from grammars
- example collections


==Location==

Assuming you have installed the libraries, you will find the precompiled
``gfc`` and ``gfr`` files directly under ``$GF_LIB_PATH``, whose default
value is ``/usr/local/share/GF/``. The precompiled subdirectories are
```
  alltenses
  mathematical
  multimodal
  present
```
Do for instance
```
  cd $GF_LIB_PATH
  gf alltenses/langs.gfcm
    
  > p -cat=S -lang=LangEng "this grammar is too big" | tb
```
For more details, see the [Synopsis synopsis.html].


==Compilation==

If you want to compile the library from scratch, use ``make`` in the root of
the source directory:
```
  cd GF/lib/resource-1.0
  make
```
The ``make`` procedure does not by default make Arabic and Catalan, but you
can uncomment the relevant lines in ``Makefile`` to compile them.


==Encoding==

Finnish, German, Romance, and Scandinavian languages are in isolatin-1.

Arabic and Russian are in UTF-8.

English is in pure ASCII.

The different encodings imply, unfortunately, that it is hard to get
a nice view of all languages simultaneously. The easiest way to achieve this is
to use ``gfeditor``, which automatically converts grammars to UTF-8.


==Using the resource as library==

This API is accessible by both ``present`` and ``alltenses``. The modules you most often need are
- ``Syntax``, the interface to syntactic structures
- ``Syntax``//L//, the implementations of ``Syntax`` for each language //L//
- ``Paradigms``//L//, the morphological paradigms for each language //L//


The [Synopsis synopsis.html] gives examples on the typical usage of these 
modules.


==Using the resource as top level grammar==

The following modules can be used for parsing and linearization. They are accessible from both
``present`` and ``alltenses``.
- ``Lang``//L// for each language //L//, implementing a common abstract syntax ``Lang``
- ``Danish``, ``English``, etc, implementing ``Lang`` with language-specific extensions


In addition, there is in both ``present`` and ``alltenses`` the file
- ``langs.gfcm``, a package with precompiled  ``Lang``//L// grammars


A way to test and view the resource grammar is to load ``langs.gfcm`` either into ``gfeditor``
or into the ``gf`` shell and perform actions such as syntax editing and treebank generation.
For instance, the command
```
  > p -lang=LangEng -cat=S "this grammar is too big" | tb
```
creates a treebank entry with translations of this sentence.

For parsing, currently only English and the Scandinavian languages are within the limits ofr
reasonable resources. For other languages //L//, parsing with ``Lang``//L// will probably eat
up the computer resources before finishing the parser generation.



==Accessing the lower level ground API==

The ``Syntax`` API is implemented in terms a bunch of ``abstract`` modules, which
as of version 1.2 are mainly interesting for implementors of the resource.
See the [documentation for version 1.1 index-1.1.html] for more details.


==Known bugs and missing components==

Danish
- the lexicon and chosen inflections are only partially verified


English 


Finnish
- wrong cases in some passive constructions


French
- multiple clitics (with V3) not always right
- third person pronominal questions with inverted word order
  have wrong forms if "t" is required e.g.
  (e.g. "comment fera-t-il" becomes "comment fera il")


German


Italian
- multiple clitics (with V3) not always right


Norwegian
- the lexicon and chosen inflections are only partially verified


Russian
- some functions missing
- some regular paradigms are missing


Spanish
- multiple clitics (with V3) not always right
- missing contractions with imperatives and clitics


Swedish
