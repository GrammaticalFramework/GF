The chart below shows the categories in a hierarchical top-down order.
The edges do not define the complete dependency structure; if they did,
the graph would have many many more edges, and also many cycles. The precise
meaning of a directed edge from //C// to //D// is: there is a constructor
of //C// that takes //D// as an argument. What the constructors exactly are,
and what other arguments they take, is described by separate tables for
each category.

The rectangular boxes mark open lexical categories, which have constructors
also in the ``Paradigms`` modules.
