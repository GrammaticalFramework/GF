One of the main ideas of
[GF ..]
is the use of libraries in grammar writing, in a way familiar
from software engineering. In this way, large grammars can
be built in cooperation, and old grammars or parts of them 
can be reused in new grammars. The slides
[Grammars as Software Libraries resource-1.0/doc/gslt-sem-2006.html]
give some introduction to this idea.



==The resource grammar library==

This library covers basic linguistic structures of 
different languages.

[Version 1.1 resource-1.0/doc] released 22 December 2006
(enhanced version of 1.0).
Covers Danish, English, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Norwegian, 
Russian, Spanish, and Swedish.

Two older versions are also available:
[Version 0.9 resource/]
and
[Version 0.6 resource-0.6/]. 



==The prelude library==

The [prelude prelude/] 
library gives utility functions for different GF applications:

[Precedence resource-1.0/doc/gfdoc/Precedence.html]. Utilities for
formal languages: precedence levels, associatives, infixes.

[Predef resource-1.0/doc/gfdoc/Predef.html]. Type signatures
of predefined (hard-coded) functions.

[Prelude resource-1.0/doc/gfdoc/Prelude.html]. Generic utilities
for strings, tables, records, booleans.
