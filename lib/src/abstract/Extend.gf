--1 Extensions of core RGL syntax (the Grammar module)

-- This module defines syntax rules that are not yet implemented in all
-- languages, and perhaps never implementable either. But all rules are given
-- a default implementation in common/ExtendFunctor.gf so that they can be included
-- in the library API. The default implementations are meant to be overridden in each
-- xxxxx/ExtendXxx.gf when the work proceeds.
--
-- This module is aimed to replace the original Extra.gf, which is kept alive just
-- for backwardcommon compatibility. It will also replace translator/Extensions.gf
-- and thus eliminate the often duplicated work in those two modules.
