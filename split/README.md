# Splitting `GF` into multiple repositories

See the [gf-dev thread](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/gf-dev/fedRMIi44pE/discussion).

The contents of this directory contain everything necessary (shell script and updated files) for performing the split.
This is a work-in-progress; once finalised, the split will be run on the latest of the `GF` repository and that repository will become frozen as an archive.

Contributions and comments welcome.

## Relevant questions

- Storing markup (e.g. txt2tags) together with HTML
- Active RGL documentation and web availability

## To check

- gf-rgl/doc contains lots of stuff which is probably outdated
