# Splitting `GF` into multiple repositories

See the [gf-dev thread](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/gf-dev/fedRMIi44pE/discussion).

The contents of this directory contain everything necessary (shell script and updated files) to performing this split.
This is a work-in-progress, once finalised and everyone has been notified, the split will be run on the latest of `GF` and that repository will become frozen as an archive.

Contributions welcome.
