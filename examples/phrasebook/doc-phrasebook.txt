=Purpose=

This phrasebook is a program for translating touristic phrases 
between 14 European languages included in the 
[MOLTO http://www.molto-project.eu] project
(Multilingual On-Line Translation):
- Bulgarian, Catalan, Danish, Dutch, English,
  Finnish, French, German, Italian, Norwegian,
  Polish, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish


A Russian version is not yet finished but is projected later. Also other languages may be added.

The phrasebook is implemented by using the GF programming language 
([Grammatical Framework http://grammaticalframework.org]).
It is the first demo for the MOLTO project, released in the third month (by June 2010).
The first version is a very small system, but it will extended in the course of the project.

The phrasebook has the following requirement specification:
- high quality: reliable translations to express yourself in any of the languages
- translation between all pairs of languages
- runnable in web browsers
- runnable on mobile phones (via web browser; Android stand-alone forthcoming)
- easily extensible by new words (forthcoming: semi-automatic extensions by users)


The phrasebook is available as open-source software, licensed under GNU LGPL. 
The source code resides in 
[``www.grammaticalframework.org/examples/phrasebook/`` http://www.grammaticalframework.org/examples/phrasebook/]



=Points illustrated=


==From the user perspective==

Interlingua-based translation
- we translate meanings, rather than words


Incremental parsing
- the user is at every point guided by the list of possible next words


Mixed modalities
- selection of words ("fridge magnets") combined with text input


Quasi-incremental translation: many basic types are also used as phrases
- one can translate both words and complete sentences, and get intermediate results


Disambiguation, esp. of politeness distinctions
- if a phrase has many translations, each of them is shown and given an explanation
  (currently just in English, later in any source language)


Fall-back to statistical translation
- currently just a link to Google translate (forthcoming: tailor-made statistical models)


Feed-back from users
- users are welcomed to send comments, bug reports, and better translation suggestions



==From the programmer's perspective==

The use of resource grammars and functors
- the translator was implemented on top of an earlier linguistic knowledge base,
  the [GF Resource Grammar Library http://www.grammaticalframework.org/lib]


Example-based grammar writing and grammar induction from statistical models 
([Google translate http://translate.google.com])
- many of the grammars were created semi-automatically by generalization from
  examples


Compile-time transfer: especially, in Action in Words
- the structural differences between languages are treated at compile time,
  for maximal run-time efficiency


The level of skills involved in grammar development
- testing different configurations (see table below)


Grammar testing
- use of treebanks with guided random generation for initial evaluation and regression testing




=Files=

==Grammars==

``Sentences``: general syntactic structures implementable in a uniform way. 
Concrete syntax via the functor ``SencencesI``.

``Words``: words and predicates, typically language-dependent. 
Separate concrete syntaxes.

``Greetings``: idiomatic phrases, string-based. 
Separate concrete syntaxes.

``Phrasebook``: the top module putting everything together. 
Separate concrete syntaxes.

``DisambPhrasebook``: disambiguation grammars generating feedback phrases if
the input language is ambiguous.

``Numeral``: resource grammar module directly inherited from the library.

Here is the module structure as produced in GF by
```
  > i -retain DisambPhrasebookEng.gf
  > dg -only=Phrasebook*,Sentences*,Words*,Greetings*,Numeral,NumeralEng,DisambPhrasebookEng
  > ! dot -Tpng _gfdepgraph.dot >pgraph.png
```

==Ontology==

The abstract syntax defines the **ontology** behind the phrasebook. 
Some explanations can be found in the 
[ontology document Ontology.html], which is produced from the
abstract syntax files
[``Sentences.gf`` http://www.grammaticalframework.org/examples/phrasebook/Sentences.gf]
and
[``Words.gf`` http://www.grammaticalframework.org/examples/phrasebook/Words.gf]
by ``make doc``.



==Run-time system and user interface==

The phrasebook uses 
the 
[PGF server http://code.google.com/p/grammatical-framework/wiki/LaunchWebDemos]
written in Haskell and the 
[minibar library http://www.grammaticalframework.org/demos/minibar/about.html]
written in JavaScript. Since the sources of these systems are available, anyone can build the phrasebook
locally on her own computer.

=Example-based grammar writing prototype=

The figure presents the process of creating a Phrasebook using an example-based 
approach for the language X, where X = {Danish, Dutch, German, Norwegian}.

[picpic.jpg]

- the first step assumes an analysis of the resource grammar and extracts the necessary 
  information that functions that build new lexical entries would need. 
  A model is built so that the proper forms of the word can be rendered, 
  and additional information, such as gender, can be inferred. The script applies 
  these rules to each entry that we want to translate into the target language, and 
  one obtains a set of constructions.
- they are furthermore given to an external translator tool (Google translate) 
  or a native speaker for translation. One needs the configuration file even if the 
  translator is human, because formal knowledge of grammar is not assumed.
- the translations into the target language are further more processed in order to 
  build the linearizations of the categories first, decoding the information received. 
  Furthermore, having the words in the lexicon, one can parse the translations of 
  functions with the GF parser and generalize from that.
- the resulting grammar is tested with the aid of a script that generates 
  constructions covering all the functions and categories from the grammar, along 
  with some other constructions that proved to be problematic in some language. 
  The result of the script contains for each construction in the target language 
  its English correspondent and the abstract syntax tree. A native speaker 
  evaluates the results and if corrections are needed, the algorithm runs again 
  with the new examples. Depending on the language skills of the grammar writer, 
  the changes can be made directly into the GF files, and the correct examples 
  given by the native informant are just kept for validating the results. 
  The algorithm is repeated as long as corrections are needed.


The time needed for preparing the configuration files for a grammar will not be needed 
in the future, since the files are reusable for other applications.
The time for the second step can be saved if automatic tools, like Google translate 
are used. This is only possible in languages with a simpler morphology and syntax 
and large corpora available.
Good results were obtained for German and Dutch with Google translate, but for 
languages like Romanian or Polish, which are both complex and lack enough resources, 
the results are discouraging. 

If the statistical oracle works well, the only step where the presence of a human 
translator is needed is the evaluation and feedback step. An average of 4 hours per 
round and 2 rounds were needed in average for the languages for which we performed 
the experiment. It is possible that more effort is needed for more complex languages.


=To Do=

Disambiguation grammars for other languages than English

Extend the abstract lexicon in ``Words`` by hand or (semi)automatically for
- food stuff
- places
- actions


Customizable phone distribution: make your own selection of the 2^15 language subsets
when downloading the phrasebook to a phone


=How to contribute=

The basic things "everyone" can do is 
- complete [missing words missing.txt] in concrete syntaxes
- add new abstract words in ``Words`` and greetings in ``Greetings``


The missing concrete syntax entries are added to the ``Words``//L//``.gf`` 
files for each language //L//. The
[morphological paradigms http://www.grammaticalframework.org/lib/doc/synopsis.html#toc78]
of the GF resource library should be used. Actions (prefixed with ``A``, as ``AWant``) are
a little more demanding, since they also require syntax constructors. Greetings (prefixed
with ``G``) are pure strings.

Some explanations can be found in the 
[implementation document Implementation.html], which is produced from the
concrete syntax files
[``SentencesI.gf`` http://www.grammaticalframework.org/examples/phrasebook/SentencesI.gf]
and
[``WordsEng.gf`` http://www.grammaticalframework.org/examples/phrasebook/WordsEng.gf]
by ``make doc``.

Here are the steps to follow for contributors:
+ Make sure you have the latest sources 
  from [GF Github http://www.grammaticalframework.org/doc/gf-developers.html], 
  using ``git pull``.
+ Also make sure that you have compiled the library by ``make present`` in ``GF/lib/src/``.
+ Work in the directory 
  [``GF/examples/phrasebook/`` http://www.grammaticalframework.org/examples/phrasebook/].
+ After you've finished your contribution, recompile the phrasebook by ``make pgf``.
+ Save your changes: ``git commit --interactive`` (in the ``phrasebook`` subdirectory).
+ Push your changes: ``git push``.
+ From the Github web site, send a pull request to the GF maintainers.
+ (Recommended:) Test the phrasebook on your local server:
  + Go to ``GF/src/server/`` and follow the instructions in the
    [project Wiki http://code.google.com/p/grammatical-framework/wiki/LaunchWebDemos].
  + Make sure that ``Phrasebook.pgf`` is available to you GF server (see project wiki).
  + Launch ``lighttpd`` (see project wiki).
  + How you can open ``GF/examples/phrasebook/www/phrasebook.html`` and use your phrasebook!


- Don't delete anything! But you are free to correct incorrect forms.
- Don't change the module structure! 
- Don't compromise quality to gain coverage: //non multa sed multum!// 




=Conclusions (tentative)=

The grammarian need not be a native speaker of the language.

For many languages, the grammarian need not even know the language - native informants are
enough.

However, evaluation by native speakers is necessary.

Correct and idiomatic translations are possible.

A typical development time was 2-3 person working days per language.

Google translate helps in bootstrapping grammars, but must be checked.
- in particular, unreliable for morphologically rich languages


Resource grammars should give some more support
- higher-level access to constructions like negative expressions
- large-scale morphological lexica
