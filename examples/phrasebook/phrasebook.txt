This phrasebook is a programme for translating touristic phrases 
between 15 European languages:

It is implemented by using the GF programming language 
([Grammatical Framework http://grammaticalframework.org]).
It is the first demo for the MOLTO project 
([Multilingual On-Line Translation http://www.molto-project.eu]).

The phrasebook has the following requirements:
- high quality: reliable translations
- translation from any language to any other ones
- runnable in web browsers
- runnable on mobile phones (also off-line: forthcoming for Android phones)
- easily extensible by new words (forthcoming: semi-automatic extensions by users)


The phrasebook is available as open-source software, licensed under GNU LGPL. 
The source code resides in

Current status (28 March 2010):
- available in English, Finnish, French, Italian, Romanian, Swedish
- very small coverage
- works on web browsers calling a server
- web service not yet released, but preliminarily available
