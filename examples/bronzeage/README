Based on grammars and lexicon in GF/examples/stoneage by Björn Bringert.
These grammars use a more varying syntax, with negation, questions,
imperatives, adverbs, and adjectival predication added.


To build the run-time grammar:

  echo "s ;; pm | wf bronzeage.gfcm" | gf -nocf Bronzeage???.gf

Before this, you have to have compiled the libraries:

  cd <whatever you need>GF/lib/resource-1.0
  make present

To work with the grammar

  gf bronzeage.gfcm

Once in GF, you can do translation,

  p -mcfg -lang=BronzeageEng "Don't eat that thick snake!" | tb

spoken-language translation (requires ATK),

  si -lang=BronzeageEng -tr | p -mcfg -lang=BronzeageEng | tb

random generation,

  gr | tb
