# `/examples`

All contributions (`contrib` and `examples` folders) have now been
moved to a separate git repository at:

https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/gf-contrib

This `examples` folder remains because its contents are compiled by
SetupWeb, so that when you run the GF cloud server locally you already
have some toy grammars to play with.

Any updates to these grammars should be made at the gf-contrib repository
above; changes will be copied from there to here manually.
