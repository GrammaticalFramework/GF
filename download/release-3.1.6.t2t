GF Version 3.1.6 Release Notes
23 April 2010


=Installation=

The binaries now work out of the box for each platform and support
completions (file names and parsing), because readline has been 
changed to haskeline.

To compile from source, GHC 6.12 is now required. But GHC is not needed
if the binary executables are used.

Binaries (``.gfo`` and ``.pgf`` files) compiled with GF 3.1 are incompatible 
with 3.1.6 and must either be removed; alternatively, the ``-src`` flag can be
used when compiling.

Notice the new place to send bug reports (see GF's welcome message)!


=New features=

Grammar language
- improved support for dependent types (see ``SUMO``, ``nqueens`` in ``examples``)


Shell commands and options (see ``help`` in GF for more information) 
- ``eb``: example-based grammar file conversion 
  (see ``examples/animals/QuestionI.gf``)
- ``vd = visualize_dependency``: show dependency tree
- ``vp = visualize_parse``: show parse tree
- ``gr, gt, mq, tq``: use a seed tree with metavariables
- ``gr, p, tq``: use ``-probs=FILE`` to bias or rank generated trees
- ``gt`` now tries the different alternatives in the order in which they appear in the source code
- ``dg``: hide modules when printing dependency graph
- -output-format=lambda_prolog let us to use Lambda Prolog for exhaustive generation with dependent types


Libraries
- Urdu completed (Shafqat Virk)
- Turkish morphology + Zamberek's dictionary in GF (Server Cimen)


Examples
- SUMO
- phrasebook
- nqueens


Internal
- single PMCFG format for both linearization and parsing
- use of Haskeline for completion - more portable than Readline
- unicode support from Haskell 6.12 instead of home-made coding


==Issues==

Javascript generation is not updated to the new PGF format.
[GF 3.1 old-index.html] should still be used for building Javascript applications.
