GF Version 3.1.6 Release Notes



=Installation=

The binaries now work out of the box for each platform and support
completions (file names and parsing), because readline has been 
changed to haskeline.

To compile from source, GHC 6.12 is now required. But GHC is not needed
if the binary executables are used.

Binaries (``.gfo`` and ``.pgf`` files) compiled with GF 3.1 are incompatible 
with 3.1.6 and must either be removed; alternatively, the ``-src`` flag can be
used when compiling.

Notice the new place to send bug reports (see GF's welcome message)!


=New features=

Grammar language
- increased support for dependent types (see ``SUMO``,
  ``category-theory`` and ``nqueens`` in ``examples``)

  (see ``examples/animals/QuestionI.gf``)
- ``vd = visualize_dependency``: show dependency tree
