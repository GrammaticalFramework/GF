Features: GF = GF shell and grammar compiler and the Resource Grammar Library,
S = ``gf -server`` mode,
C = C run-time system,
J/P = Java/Python binding to the C run-time system

%More binary packages might be added later.

===Notes===

The Windows package is installed by just unpacking it anywhere.
%It finds the libraries relative to the ``.exe`` file.
You will probably need to set the ``PATH`` and ``GF_LIB_PATH`` environment
variables, see Inari's notes on
[Installing GF on Windows http://www.grammaticalframework.org/~inari/gf-windows.html#toc3].

%The new experimental MINGW package is for use in the
%[MINGW http://www.mingw.org] environment in Windows. Unpack it in the MSYS shell
%(which is started with ``C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\msys.bat``).
%It should work out of the box without any additional settings.

The ``.deb`` packages should work on Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04 and 16.04 and similar
Linux distributions.

The packages for Mac OS X should work on at least 10.9, 10.10 and 10.11 (Mavericks, Yosemite and El Capitan).

(*) **Note** that for compatibility with OS X 10.11, 
``gf-3.8.pkg`` will install the ``gf`` executable in ``/usr/local/bin``
instead of ``/usr/bin``, so make sure ``/usr/local/bin`` is in your  ``$PATH``.
Also, if you still have an older version of GF installed in ``/usr/bin``,
remove it and/or make sure ``/usr/local/bin`` comes before ``/usr/bin``
in your ``$PATH`` so you don't accidentally run the old version.

The Mac OS and Linux ``.tar.gz`` packages are designed to be installed in
``/usr/local``.
You can install them in other locations, but then you need to set the
``GF_LIB_PATH`` environment variable:

```
  export GF_LIB_PATH=/usr/local/share/gf-3.8/lib
```

where ``/usr/local`` should be replaced with the path to the location where you
unpacked the package.


==Installing the latest release from source==

[GF is on Hackage http://hackage.haskell.org/package/gf], so under normal
circumstances the prodedure is fairly simple:

+ Install a recent version of the
  [Haskell Platform http://hackage.haskell.org/platform],
  e.g. version 7.10.3 (see note 2 below)
+ ``cabal update``
+ On Linux: install some C libraries from your Linux distribution
  (see note 1 below)
+ ``cabal install gf``


You can also download the full source package from here:
[``gf-3.8.tar.gz`` gf-3.8.tar.gz].

=== Notes ===

The above steps installs GF for a single user.
% and does not require root privileges.
The executables are put in ``$HOME/.cabal/bin``
(or, with recent versions of the Haskell platform on Mac OS X,
in ``$HOME/Library/Haskell/bin``), so it is a good
idea to put a line in your ``.bash_profile`` or ``.profile``
to add that directory to you path:

```
  PATH=$HOME/.cabal/bin:$PATH
```
or
```
  PATH=$HOME/Library/Haskell/bin:$PATH
```

**Note 1**.
GF uses [``haskeline`` http://hackage.haskell.org/package/haskeline], which
on Linux depends on some non-Haskell libraries that
won't be installed automatically by cabal, and therefore need to be installed
manually. Here is one way to do this:

- On Ubuntu: ``sudo apt-get install libghc-haskeline-dev``
- On Fedora: ``sudo yum install ghc-haskeline-devel``


**Note 2**.
The GF source code has been updated to compile with GHC 8.0.1. Using older
versions of GHC (7.10.3, 7.10.2, 7.8, 7.6) should work too.

=== Known problems ===

There seems to be a bug in some versions of Cabal that can cause

```
  Distribution/Simple/PackageIndex.hs:124:8-13: Assertion failed
```

if the same version of GF is
already installed. If you encounter this, you can use ``ghc-pkg unregister gf``
to remove the installed version of GF and ``ghc-pkg list gf`` to verify that
it is gone.
