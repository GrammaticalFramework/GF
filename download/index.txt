==Installation instructions==

To install a binary, just uncompress it and copy to a place that is on your path,
for instance, in ``/usr/local/bin``. You may want to rename it to ``gf``.

If you want to use GF as a batch compiler, put the following script in the
same place as the GF binary. If it is //not// ``/usr/local/bin``, change
the ``prefix`` variable in the script.

- [gfc script for patch compiler ./gfc]


The Mac OS X binary (Intel) requires Readline from
[Mac Ports http://www.macports.org/]. To install, see above item.

The Windows binary is easiest if you have
[Cygwin http://www.cygwin.com/]. To install, see above item.

To compile and install from source: 
```
  tar xvfz gf-3.0beta.tgz
  cd GF/src
  autoconf
  ./configure
  make
  make install
```
To install the libraries, unpack them in the place to which your
``GF_LIB_PATH`` points.
```
  cd $GF_LIB_PATH
  gtar xvfz gf-lib-1.4.tgz
```
If this variable hasn't been defined, it is useful define it, e.g.
```
  export GF_LIB_PATH=/usr/local/lib/gf/
```
