Before compiling Java binding you first need to have the C runtime 
compiled and installed. In order to compile the binding itself you need
Eclipse plus the plugin for compiling C projects in 
Eclipse (https://www.eclipse.org/cdt). Follow the instructions on 
the web site.

After you have done the above, import the directory where you have found 
this INSTALL file as an existing project in Eclipse. The project has
two configurations one for Posix (Linux) systems and one for Windows.
You can change the configuration by right clicking on the project
and choosing "Properties" from the menu. Then go to C/C++ Build
and click on the button "Manage Configurations". Change the active
configuration from there. Now go to "C/C++ Build / Tool Chain Editor"
and check whether the current tool chain is the one for your platform.

On Windows you might also have to change the following directories
from the "Properties" dialog:

C/C++ Build / Settings / GCC C Compiler / Includes / Include paths
C/C++ Build / Settings / MinGW C++ Linker / Libraries / Library search paths
