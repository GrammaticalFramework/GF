<h1>About Minibar</h1>

<a href="minibar.html">Minibar</a> is an alternative implementation of the
<a href="http://www.grammaticalframework.org:41296/fridge/">Fridge Poetry web app</a>.
It doesn't do everything the original Fridge Poetry does (e.g. drag-and-drop is missing),
so I refer to it as a minibar rather than a full refrigerator :-)

<p>
Some implementation details:

<ul class=space>
  <li>It is implemented directly in JavaScipt. It does not use Google Web Toolkit or any big JavaScript libraries.
  <li>It has been tested and found to work in the following browsers:
  <ul>
    <li>On the Mac: Firefox 3.5 &amp; 3.6, Safari 4.0, Opera 10.10 and
    Google Chrome 4.0.249.49.
    <li>On Linux: Firefox 3.0.18 & 3.5, Opera 10.10.
    <li>On the Android Dev Phone: Android Mobile Safari 3.0.4 & 3.1.2
    and Android Opera Mini 4.2.
  </ul>
  It does not seem work in Internet Explorer 7
  (there are both styling and scripting issues). There seems to be some rendering bugs
  in Chrome 5.0.342.9 β.
  <li>The implementation consist of two JavaScript files:
  <a href="minibar.js">minibar.js</a> and <a href="support.js">support.js</a>
  The latter is also used in a small web app based on the
  <a href="http://spraakbanken.gu.se/sal/ws/">SALDO web services</a>.
  <li>To access the GF web service, it uses the
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#JSONP">JSONP method</a>
  mentioned in the GF
  web services paper, which allows the web app to be hosted on a different server
  from the GF web service. (To demonstrate this, I put the Minibar demo on
  www.cs.chalmers.se, while the GF server that it calls is on
  www.grammaticalframework.org.)
  <li>As an experiment, it does no use the <code>grammars.xml</code> file,
  but instead calls a little CGI script,
  <a href="http://www.grammaticalframework.org:41296/grammars/grammars.cgi.txt">grammars.cgi</a>
  which lists the .pgf in the directory, in JSONP format. (Note: if you want to install
  this on your own computer,
  <ul>
    <li>if you click on the link,
        the CGI script will be downloaded as <code>grammars.cgi.txt</code>,
        but it should be called <code>grammars.cgi</code> and stored on the server
        in the same directory as the grammar files.
    <li>for CGI scripts to work with lighttpd, <code>"mod_cgi"</code> needs to be included
    in the definition of <code>server.modules</code> in the
    <code>lighttpd.conf</code> file.)
  </ul>
  <li>[Added 2010-02-16] There is a button for generating random sentences.
  <li>[Added 2010-02-23] All translations are shown, not just the first one, if there are
  multiple parses.
  <li>[Added 2010-02-25] Next to each translation, there is now a little tree icon that
  you can click on to see a drawing of an abstract syntax tree or a parse tree. If you click
  on a drawing it collapses back into a tree icon.
</ul>
Work in progress:
<ul>
  <li>[Added 2010-04-09] Preparations to support different ways to access the grammar:
  currently we access a PGF server via JSONP, but I would also like to support AJAX,
  and local/downloaded JavaScript grammars.
  <li>[Added 2010-04-19] A text entry field appears when you click in
  the sentence area (with a dashed border). This allows you to enter words by typing on
  the keyboard. As you start typing word magnets that don't match what you are typing
  are removed. When only one magnet remains, you can press enter to complete the word.
  <li>[Added 2010-04-19] There is a menu for choosing the output language:
  you can pick "All" to translate to all available languages, or pick one particular
  language.
  <li>[Added 2010-04-19] You can pass options to the function <code>start_minibar</code>
  to customize the user interface. The default is
  <code>{show_abstract:true,show_trees:true}</code> to show the abstract syntax of parsed
  sentences, and to show icons that expand to syntax/parse trees next each translation.
  These features can be turned off by setting the fields to <code>false</code>.
</ul>
