You will need the package: libtool

The compilation steps are:

$ autoreconf -i
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

If you want to use the statistical ranking in the parser then you
have to compile your grammar with the option '-probs=grammar.probs',
where grammar.probs must contain a tab separated file with
the probabilities for all functions in the abstract syntax.
In order to enable the named entity recongizer for the ParseEngAbs
grammar you also have to add the option '-literal=Symb' while compiling.

Note For Mac OSX users
----------------------

The following is what I did to make it work on MacOSX 10.8:

- Install XCode and XCode command line tools
- Install Homebrew: http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/

$ brew install automake autoconf libtool
$ glibtoolize
$ autoreconf -i
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
