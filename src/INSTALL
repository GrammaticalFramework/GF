To make and install GF2 (Version 2-beta, 2/4/2004).

1. Unpack GF2 and go to the source directory (the place where this 
   INSTALL file is!)

     tar tgz gf2-beta.tgz
     cd GF2/src

2. Make sure you have GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler), version 5.02 or later.
   In Windows, you also need Cygwin.

     ghc --version

3. Compile with make, either of

     make unix    -- for Linux, Solaris, Mac OSX
     make windows -- for MS Windows

   The binary is sent to the file GF2/bin/gf2

4. For a quick test: start GF2, load a grammar and parse a string:

     cd ../grammars/basic
     ../../bin/gf2 English.gf

     -- when GF2 has started and shows the prompt >:
     > p "every number is even or odd"
     -- this is the response from GF2:
     PredA1 (Every Number) (DisjA1 Even Odd)

5. If you want to run the Java GUI, go back to GF2/src and also do

     make install-java

   Then edit the file GF2/bin/jgf2 by changing
   the value of GFHOME to the location of your GF2/bin directory. Test the
   GUI with some grammars:

     cd ../grammars/letter
     ../../bin/gf2 <mkLetter.gfs
     ../../bin/jgf2 Letter.gfcm

   When the window opens, push the Random button.
