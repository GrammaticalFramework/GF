-- GF help file updated for GF 2.0, 24/3/2004.
-- *: Commands and options marked with * are not yet implemented.
--
-- Each command has a long and a short name, options, and zero or more
-- arguments. Commands are sorted by functionality. The short name is
-- given first.

-- commands that change the state

i, import: i File
      Reads a grammar from File and compiles it into a GF runtime grammar.
      Files "include"d in File are read recursively, nubbing repetitions.
      If a grammar with the same language name is already in the state,
      it is overwritten - but only if compilation succeeds. 
      The grammar parser depends on the file name suffix:
        .gf    normal GF source
        .gfc   canonical GF
        .gfr   precompiled GF resource  
        .gfcm  multilingual canonical GF
       *.ebnf  Extended BNF format
       *.cf    Context-free (BNF) format
  options:
      -old          old: parse in GF<2.0 format
      -v            verbose: give lots of messages 
      -s            silent: don't give error messages
      -opt          perform branch-sharing optimization
     *-src          source: ignore precompiled gfc and gfr files 
      -nocf         don't build context-free grammar (thus no parser)
      -nocheckcirc  don't eliminate circular rules from CF 
      -cflexer      build an optimized parser with separate lexer trie
  flags:
      -abs          set the name used for abstract syntax (with -old option)
      -cnc          set the name used for concrete syntax (with -old option)
      -res          set the name used for resource (with -old option)
      
* rl, remove_language: rl Language
      Takes away the language from the state.

e,  empty: e
      Takes away all languages and resets all global flags.

sf, set_flags: sf Language? Flag*
      The values of the Flags are set for Language. If no language
      is specified, the flags are set globally.

s,  strip: s
      Prune the state by removing source and resource modules.

-- commands that give information about the state

pg, print_grammar: pg
      Prints the actual grammar (overridden by the -lang=X flag).
      The -printer=X flag sets the format in which the grammar is
      written.
      N.B. since grammars are compiled when imported, this command
      generally does not show the grammar in the same format as the
      source. In particular, the -printer=latex is not supported. 
      Use the command tg -printer=latex File to print the source 
      grammar in LaTeX.
  options:
      -utf8  apply UTF8-encoding to the grammar
  flags: 
      -printer
      -lang

pm, print_multigrammar: pm
      Prints the current multilingual grammar into a .gfcm file.
      (Automatically executes the strip command (s) before doing this.)

po, print_options: po
      Print what modules there are in the state. Also
      prints those flag values in the current state that differ from defaults.

pl, print_languages: pl
      Prints the names of currently available languages.

pi, print_info: pi Ident
      Prints information on the identifier.

-- commands that execute and show the session history

eh, execute_history: eh File
      Executes commands in the file.

ph, print_history; ph
      Prints the commands issued during the GF session.
      The result is readable by the eh command.
      HINT: write "ph | wf foo.hist" to save the history.


-- linearization, parsing, translation, and computation

l,  linearize: l PattList? Tree
      Shows all linearization forms of Tree by the actual grammar
      (which is overridden by the -lang flag). 
      The pattern list has the form [P, ... ,Q] where P,...,Q follow GF 
      syntax for patterns. All those forms are generated that match with the
      pattern list. Too short lists are filled with variables in the end.
      Only the -table flag is available if a pattern list is specified.
      HINT: see GF language specification for the syntax of Pattern and Term.
      You can also copy and past parsing results.
  options:  
      -table   show parameters
      -struct  bracketed form
      -record  record, i.e. explicit GF concrete syntax term
  flags:
      -lang    linearize in this grammar
      -number  give this number of forms at most
      -unlexer filter output through unlexer

p,  parse: p String
      Shows all Trees returned for String by the actual
      grammar (overridden by the -lang flag), in the category S (overridden
      by the -cat flag).
  options:
      -n       non-strict: tolerates morphological errors
      -ign     ignore unknown words when parsing
      -raw     return context-free terms in raw form
      -v       verbose: give more information if parsing fails
  flags:
      -cat     parse in this category
      -lang    parse in this grammar
      -lexer   filter input through this lexer
      -parser  use this context-free parsing method
      -number  return this many results at most

tt, test_tokenizer: tt String
      Show the token list sent to the parser when String is parsed.
      HINT: can be useful when debugging the parser.
  flags: 
     -lexer    use this lexer

cc, compute_concrete: cc Ident Term
      Compute a term by concrete syntax definitions.
      The identifier Ident is a resource module name 
      needed to resolve constant. 
      N.B. You need the flag -src when importing the grammar, if you want 
      the oper definitions to be retained after compilation; otherwise this
      command does not expand oper constants.
      N.B.' The resulting Term is not a term in the sense of abstract syntax,
      and hence not a valid input to a Tree-demanding command.

t, translate: t Lang Lang String
      Parses String in Lang1 and linearizes the resulting Trees in Lang2.
  flags:
      -cat
      -lexer
      -parser

gr, generate_random: gr
      Generates a random Tree.
  flags:
      -cat     generate in this category
      -lang    use the abstract syntax of this grammar
      -number  generate this number of trees
      -depth   use this number of search steps at most

ma, morphologically_analyse: ma String
      Runs morphological analysis on each word in String and displays
      the results line by line.
  options:
      -short   show analyses in bracketed words, instead of separate lines
  flags:
      -lang


-- elementary generation of Strings and Trees

ps, put_string: ps String
      Returns its argument String, like Unix echo.
      HINT. The strength of ps comes from the possibility to receive the 
      argument from a pipeline, and altering it by the -filter flag.
  flags:
      -filter  filter the result through this string processor 
      -length  cut the string after this number of characters

pt, put_tree: pt Tree
      Returns its argument Tree, like a specialized Unix echo.
      HINT. The strength of pt comes from the possibility to receive 
      the argument from a pipeline, and altering it by the -transform flag.
  flags:
      -transform   transform the result by this term processor
      -number      generate this number of terms at most

* st, show_tree: st Tree
      Prints the tree as a string. Unlike pt, this command cannot be
      used in a pipe to produce a tree, since its output is a string.
  flags:
      -printer     show the tree in a special format (-printer=xml supported)


-- subshells

es, editing_session: es
      Opens an interactive editing session.
      N.B. Exit from a Fudget session is to the Unix shell, not to GF. 
  options:
      -f Fudget GUI (necessary for Unicode; only available in X Window System)

ts, translation_session: ts
      Translates input lines from any of the actual languages to any other one.
      To exit, type a full stop (.) alone on a line.
      N.B. Exit from a Fudget session is to the Unix shell, not to GF. 
      HINT: Set -parser and -lexer locally in each grammar.
  options:
      -f Fudget GUI (necessary for Unicode; only available in X Window System)
  flags:
      -cat

tq, translation_quiz: tq Lang Lang
      Random-generates translation exercises from Lang1 to Lang2,
      keeping score of success.
      To interrupt, type a full stop (.) alone on a line.
      HINT: Set -parser and -lexer locally in each grammar.
  flags:
      -cat

tl, translation_list: tl Lang Lang Int
      Random-generates a list of Int translation exercises from Lang1 to Lang2.
      HINT: use wf to save the exercises in a file.
  flags:
      -cat

mq, morphology_quiz: mq
      Random-generates morphological exercises,
      keeping score of success.
      To interrupt, type a full stop (.) alone on a line.
      HINT: use printname judgements in your grammar to
      produce nice expressions for desired forms.
  flags:
      -cat
      -lang

ml, morphology_list: ml Int
      Random-generates a list of Int morphological exercises,
      keeping score of success.
      HINT: use wf to save the exercises in a file.
  flags:
      -cat
      -lang


-- IO related commands

rf, read_file: rf File
      Returns the contents of File as a String; error is File does not exist.

wf, write_file: wf File String
      Writes String into File; File is created if it does not exist.
      N.B. the command overwrites File without a warning.

af, append_file: af File
      Writes String into the end of File; File is created if it does not exist.

* tg, transform_grammar: tg File
      Reads File, parses as a grammar, 
      but instead of compiling further, prints it. 
      The environment is not changed. When parsing the grammar, the same file
      name suffixes are supported as in the i command.
      HINT: use this command to print the grammar in 
      another format (the -printer flag); pipe it to wf to save this format.
  flags:
      -printer  (only -printer=latex supported currently)

* cl, convert_latex: cl File
      Reads File, which is expected to be in LaTeX form.
      Three environments are treated in special ways:
        \begGF    - \end{verbatim}, which contains GF judgements,
        \begTGF   - \end{verbatim}, which contains a GF expression (displayed)
        \begInTGF - \end{verbatim}, which contains a GF expressions (inlined).
      Moreover, certain macros should be included in the file; you can
      get those macros by applying 'tg -printer=latex foo.gf' to any grammar
      foo.gf. Notice that the same File can be imported as a GF grammar,
      consisting of all the judgements in \begGF environments.
      HINT: pipe with 'wf Foo.tex' to generate a new Latex file.

sa, speak_aloud: sa String
      Uses the Festival speech generator to produce speech for String.
      The command cupports Festival's language flag, which is sent verbatim
      to Festival, e.g. -language=spanish. Omitting this flag gives the 
      system-dependent default voice (often British English).
     flags:
       -language

h, help: h
      Displays this help message.

q, quit: q
      Exits GF.
      HINT: you can use 'ph | wf history' to save your session.

!, system_command: ! String
      Issues a system command. No value is returned to GF.
