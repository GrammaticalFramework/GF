We collect GF modes for various editors on this page. Contributions are
welcome!


==Emacs==

[gf.el ../src/tools/gf.el] by Johan Bockg√•rd provides syntax highlighting and
automatic indentation and lets you run the GF Shell in an emacs buffer.
See installation instructions inside.

==Gedit==

By John J. Camilleri

Copy the file below to
``~/.local/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/gf.lang`` (under Ubuntu).

- [gf.lang ../src/tools/gf.lang]


Some helpful notes/links:

- The code is based heavily on the ``haskell.lang`` file which I found in
  ``/usr/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs/haskell.lang``.
- Ruslan Osmanov recommends
  [registering your file extension as its own MIME type http://osmanov-dev-notes.blogspot.com/2011/04/how-to-add-new-highlight-mode-in-gedit.html]
  (see also [here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AddingMimeTypes]),
  however on my system the ``.gf`` extension was already registered
  as a generic font (``application/x-tex-gf``) and I didn't want to risk
  messing any of that up.
- This is a quick 5-minute job and might require some tweaking.
  [The GtkSourceView language definition tutorial http://developer.gnome.org/gtksourceview/stable/lang-tutorial.html]
  is the place to start looking.
- Contributions are welcome!


==Geany==

By John J. Camilleri

[Custom filetype http://www.geany.org/manual/dev/index.html#custom-filetypes]
config files for syntax highlighting in [Geany http://www.geany.org/].

Copy one of the files below to ``/usr/share/geany/filetypes.GF.conf``
(under Ubuntu). You will need to manually create the file.

- [light-filetypes.GF.conf ../src/tools/light-filetypes.GF.conf]
- [dark-filetypes.GF.conf ../src/tools/dark-filetypes.GF.conf]


You will also need to edit the ``filetype_extensions.conf`` file and add the
following line somewhere:

```
GF=*.gf
```


==Vim==
