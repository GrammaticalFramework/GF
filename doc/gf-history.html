<h1>Grammatical Framework History of Changes</h1>



Changes in functionality since May 17, 2005, release of GF Version 2.2

</center>

<p>

3/6 (AR) The format <tt>.gfe</tt> defined to support
<b>grammar writing by examples</b>. Files of this format are first
converted to <tt>.gf</tt> files by the command
<pre>
  gf -examples File.gfe
</pre>
See <a href="../lib/resource/doc/examples/QuestionsI.gfe">
<tt>../lib/resource/doc/examples/QuestionsI.gfe</tt></a>
for an example.

<p>

31/5 (AR) Default of p -rawtrees=k changed to 999999.

<p>

31/5 (AR) Support for restricted inheritance. Syntax:
<pre>
  M          -- inherit everything from M, as before
  M [a,b,c]  -- only inherit constants a,b,c
  M-[a,b,c]  -- inherit everything except a,b,c
</pre>
Caution: there is no check yet for completeness and
consistency, but restricted inheritance can create
run-time failures.

<p>

29/5 (AR) Parser support for reading GFC files line per line.
The category <tt>Line</tt> in <tt>GFC.cf</tt> can be used
as entrypoint instead of <tt>Grammar</tt> to achieve this.

<p>

28/5 (AR) Environment variables and path wild cards.
<ul>
<li> <tt>GF_LIB_PATH</tt> gives the location of <tt>GF/lib</tt>
<li> <tt>GF_GRAMMAR_PATH</tt> gives a list of directories appended
     to the explicitly given path
<li> <tt>DIR/*</tt> is expanded to the union of all subdirectories
     of <tt>DIR</tt>
</ul>
<p>


26/5/2005 (BB) Notation for list categories.
