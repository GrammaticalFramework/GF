<h1>Grammatical Framework Quick Start</h1>

</center>

This Quick Start shows two examples of how GF can be used.
We assume that you have downloaded and installed GF, so that
the command <tt>gf</tt> works for you. See download and install
instructions <a href="http://digitalgrammars.com/gf/download/">here</a>.



<h2>Translation and generation</h2>

When you have downloaded and installed GF:
<ol>
<li> Copy the files
<a href="../examples/tutorial/food/Food.gf"><tt>Food.gf</tt></a>,
<a href="../examples/tutorial/food/FoodEng.gf"><tt>FoodEng.gf</tt></a>, and
<a href="../examples/tutorial/food/FoodIta.gf"><tt>FoodIta.gf</tt></a>.
Or go to <tt>GF/examples/tutorial/food/</tt>, if you have downloaded the
GF sources.

 <li> Start GF with the command
<pre>
  gf FoodIta.gf FoodEng.gf
</pre>

<li> <b>Translation</b>. Try your first translation by giving the GF command
<pre>
  parse "this cheese is very very Italian" | tree_bank
</pre>

<li> <b>Generation</b>. Random-generate sentences in two languages:
<pre>
  generate_random | l -multi
</pre>

<li> <b>Grammar development</b>. Add words to the <tt>Food</tt>
grammars and try the above commands again. For instance, add the following lines:
<pre>
  Bread : Kind ;          -- in Food.gf
  Black = {s = "bread"} ; -- in FoodEng.gf
  Black = {s = "pane"} ;  -- in FoodIta.gf
</pre>
and start GF again with the same command. Now you can even translate
<i>this bread is very Italian</i>.
</ol>
To lear more on GF commands and
grammar development, go to the
<a href="tutorial/gf-tutorial2.html">New Grammarian's Tutorial</a>.



<h2>Multilingual authoring</h2>

This demo also requires the GUI package, which makes the command
<tt>jgf</tt> work for you.
<ol>
<li> Download the file <a href="../examples/letter/Letter.gfcm"><tt>Letter.gfcm</tt></a>.
<li> Start the GF editor by the command
<pre>
  gfeditor Letter.gfcm
</pre>
<li> When the editor window is open, select "Letter" from the "New" menu.
<li> Push the button "Random" in the lower end of the window.
<li> Move the pointer to some place in the text, e.g. to the first word (in any
  of the languages), and click. The first word should now be highlighted and
  a number of alternatives appear in the lower window part (a similar situation
  is shown in the picture below).
<li> Double-click at some of the alternatives marked "ch ..." and observe how
  the text changes in each of the languages.
</ol>
See the <a href="http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~aarne/GF2.0/doc/javaGUImanual/javaGUImanual.htm">Editor User Manual</a>
for more information on how to use the
editor. To change the grammars, you should not edit <tt>Letter.gfcm</tt>,
which is low-level code generated by the GF grammar compiler. Instead, you
can edit the files in <tt>examples/letter</tt> in the GF grammar package,
and compile by using the script <tt>mkLetter.gfs</tt> in the same package.
