<h2>Syntax of GF</h2>

An accurate <a href="DocGF.ps.gz">language specification</a> is now available.


<h2>Summary of novelties</h2>

<h4>Module system</h4>

<li> Separate modules for <tt>abstract</tt>, 
     <tt>concrete</tt>, and <tt>resource</tt>.
<li> Replaces the file-based <tt>include</tt> system
<li> Name space handling with qualified names
<li> Hierarchic structure (<tt>extend</tt>) + cross-cutting reuse (<tt>open</tt>)
<li> Separate compilation, one module per file
<li> Reuse of <tt>abstract</tt>+<tt>concrete</tt> as <tt>resource</tt>
<li> New module types:
     <tt>interface</tt>, <tt>instance</tt>, <tt>incomplete</tt>.
<li> New experimental module types: <tt>transfer</tt>, 
     <tt>union</tt>.

<h4>Canonical format GFC</h4>

<li> The target of GF compiler; to reuse, just read in
<li> Readable by Haskell/Java/C++/C applications

<h4>New features in expression language</h4>

<li> Disjunctive patterns <tt>P | ... | Q</tt>.
<li> String patterns <tt>"foo"</tt>.
<li> Binding token <tt>&+</tt> to glue separate tokens at unlexing phase, 
     and unlexer to resolve this.
<li> New syntax alternatives for local definitions: <tt>let</tt> without
     braces and <tt>where</tt>.
<li> Pattern variables can be used on lhs's of <tt>oper</tt> definitions.
<li> New Unicode transliterations (by Harad Hammarström).

<h4>New parser (forthcoming)</h4>

<li> By Peter Ljunglöf, based on MCFG
<li> Much more efficient for morphology and discontinuous constituents
<li> Treatment of cyclic rules

<h4>New editor features</h4>

<li> Active text field (forthcoming, by Janna Khegai)
<li> Clipboard

<h4>Improved implementation</h4>

<li> Haskell source code organized into subdirectories.
<li> BNF Converter used for defining the languages GF and GFC, which also
     give reliable LaTeX documentation.
<li> Lexican rules sorted out by option <tt>-cflexer</tt> for efficient
     parsing with large lexica.

<h2>Status (24/3/2004)</h2>

Grammar compiler, editor GUIs, and shell work.

<p>

The updated <tt>HelpFile</tt> (accessible through <tt>h</tt> command)
marks unsupported but expected features with <tt>*</tt>.

<p>

GF1 grammars can be automatically translated to GF2 (although result not as good
as manual, since indentation and comments are destroyed). The results can be 
saved in GF2 files, but this is not necessary.

<p>

It is also possible to write a GF2 grammar back to GF1.


<p>

Example grammars and resource libraries are have been
converted. There is a new resource API with
many new constructions. The new versions lie in <tt>grammars/newresource</tt>.

<p>

A make facility works, finding out which modules have to be recompiled.
There is some room for improvement.

<p>

<tt>transfer</tt> modules have to be called by flags.

<p>


Soundness checking of module depencencies and completeness is not
complete. This means that some errors may show up too late.

<h2>How to use GF 1.* files</h2>

The import command <tt>i</tt> is given the option <tt>-old</tt>. E.g.
<pre>
  i -old tut1.Eng.g2
</pre>
This generates, internally, three modules:
<pre>
  abstract tut1 = ...
  resource ResEng = ...
  concrete Eng of tut1 = open ResEng in ...
</pre>
(The names are different if the file name has fewer parts.)

<p>

The option <tt>-o</tt> causes GF2 to write these modules into files.

<p>

The flags <tt>-abs</tt>, <tt>-cnc</tt>, and <tt>-res</tt> can be used
to give custom names to the modules. In particular, it is good to use
the <tt>-abs</tt> flag to guarantee that the abstract syntax module
has the same name for all grammars in a multilingual environmens:
<pre>
  i -old -abs=Numerals hungarian.gf
  i -old -abs=Numerals tamil.gf
  i -old -abs=Numerals sanskrit.gf
</pre>

<p>

The same flags as in the import command can be used when invoking
GF2 from the system shell. Many grammars can be imported on the same command
line, e.g.
<pre>
  % gf2 -old -abs=Tutorial tut1.Eng.gf tut1.Fin.gf tut1.Fra.gf
</pre>

<p>

To write a GF2 grammar back to GF1 (as one big file), use the command
<pre>
  > pg -old
</pre>


<p>


GF2 has more reserved words than GF 1.2. When old files are read, a preprocessor
replaces every identifier that has the shape of a new reserved word
with a variant where the last letter is replaced by <tt>Z</tt>, e.g.
<tt>instance</tt> is replaced by <tt>instancZ</tt>. This method is of course
unsafe and should be replaced by something better.

<h2>Abstract, concrete, and resource modules</h2>

Judgement forms are sorted as follows:
<ul>
<li> abstract: 
  <tt>cat</tt>, <tt>fun</tt>, <tt>def</tt>, <tt>data</tt>, <tt>flags</tt>
<li> concrete: 
  <tt>lincat</tt>, <tt>cat</tt>, <tt>printname</tt>, <tt>flags</tt>
<li> resource: 
  <tt>param</tt>, <tt>oper</tt>, <tt>flags</tt>
<li> 
</ul>
Example:
<pre>
  abstract Sums = {
    cat 
      Exp ;
    fun 
      One : Exp ;
      plus : Exp -> Exp -> Exp ;
  }

  concrete EnglishSums of Sums = open ResEng in {
    lincat 
      Exp = {s : Str ; n : Number} ;
    lin
      One = expSg "one" ;
      sum x y = expSg ("the" ++ "sum" ++ "of" ++ x.s ++ "and" ++ y.s) ;
  }

  resource ResEng = {
    param 
      Number = Sg | Pl ;
    oper 
      expSG : Str -> {s : Str ; n : Number} = \s -> {s = s ; n = Sg} ;
  }
</pre>



<!-- NEW -->

<h2>Opening and extending modules</h2>

A <tt>concrete</tt> or <tt>resource</tt> can <b>open</b> a
<tt>resource</tt>. This means that
<ul>
<li> the names defined in <tt>resource</tt> can be used ("become visible")
<li> but: these names are not included in ("exported from") the opening module
</ul>
A module of any type can moreover <b>extend</b> a module of the same type.
This means that
<ul>
<li> the names defined in the extended module can be used ("become visible")
<li> and also: these names are included in ("exported from") the extending module
</ul>
Examples of extension:
<pre>
  abstract Products = Sums ** {
    fun times : Exp -> Exp -> Exp ;
  }
  -- names exported: Exp, plus, times

  concrete English of Products = EnglishSums ** open ResEng in {
    lin times x y = expSg ("the" ++ "product" ++ "of" ++ x.s ++ "and" ++ y.s) ;
  }
</pre>
Another important difference:
<li> extension is single
<li> opening can be multiple: <tt>open Foo, Bar, Baz in {...}</tt>

<p>

Moreover:
<li> opening can be <b>qualified</b>
<p>
Example of qualified opening:
<pre>
  concrete NumberSystems of Systems = open (Bin = Binary), (Dec = Decimal) in {
    lin 
      BZero = Bin.Zero ;
      DZero = Dec.Zero
  }
</pre>

<h2>Compiling modules</h2>

Separate compilation assumes there is <b>one module per file</b>.

<p>

The <b>module header</b> is the beginning of the module code up to the
first left bracket (<tt>{</tt>). The header gives
<ul>
<li> the module type: <tt>abstract</tt>, <tt>concrete</tt> (<tt>of</tt> <i>A</i>), 
  or <tt>resource</tt>
<li> the name of the module (next to the module type keyword)
<li> the name of extended module (between <tt>=</tt> and <tt>**</tt>)
<li> the names of opened modules
</ul>

<p>

<b>filename</b> = <b>modulename</b> <tt>.</tt> <b>extension</b>

<p>

File name extensions:
<ul>
<li> <tt>gf</tt>: GF source file (uses GF syntax, is type checked and compiled)
<li> <tt>gfc</tt>: canonical GF file (uses GFC syntax, is only read in; produced 
from all kinds of modules)
<li> <tt>gfr</tt>: GF resource file (uses GF syntax, is only read in; produced from
<tt>resource</tt> modules)
</ul>
Only <tt>gf</tt> files should ever be written/edited manually!

<p>

What the make facility does when compiling <tt>Foo.gf</tt>
<ol>
<li> read the module header of <tt>Foo.gf</tt>, and recursively all headers from
the modules it <b>depends</b> on (i.e. extends or opens) 
<li> build a dependency graph of these modules, and do topological sorting
<li> starting from the first module in topological order,
compare the modification times of each <tt>gf</tt> and <tt>gfc</tt> file:
<ul>
<li> if <tt>gf</tt> is later, compile the module and all modules depending on it
<li> if <tt>gfc</tt> is later, just read in the module
</ul>
</ol>
Inside the GF shell, also time stamps of modules read into memory are
taken into account. Thus a module need not be read from a file if the
module is in the memory and the file has not been modified.
