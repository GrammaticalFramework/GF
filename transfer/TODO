* Improve front-end language

- Tuple syntax in expressions, types and patterns. Implemented with records.

- List syntax in expressions, types and patterns. Implemented with List.

- operators for primitive string operations: 

- list operators: ++, :

- overloaded operators?

- implicit arguments?

- composOp generation

- show generation

- eq generation

- better module system

- Disjunctive patterns

- Negated patterns?

- Patterns with guards

- Layout syntax resolver gets this wrong:

main = let x : Type = case n of
		n2 -> 2
		n3 -> 3
        in f Numeral

* Improve interpreter

- More efficient handling of constructor application

* Improve the core language

* Improve compilation

* Add primitive operations to core

- primitive operations on strings:

- add floating-point numbers with primitive oeprations?

* Implement module system in interpreter

* Add type checker for core

* Add friendly type checker for front-end language

* Add termination checker
