<H2>Book description</H2>
<P>
Grammars of natural languages are complex systems, and their 
computer implementation requires both programming skills and 
linguistic knowledge, especially when dealing with other languages
than English. This book makes such tasks accessible for a wide 
range of programmers. It introduces GF (Grammatical Framework),
which is a programming language designed for writing grammars, which
may moreover address several languages in parallel. 
The book shows how to write grammars in GF and use them in applications 
such as tourist phrasebooks, spoken dialogue systems, and natural 
language interfaces. The examples and exercises address several 
languages, and the readers are guided to look at their own languages 
from the computational perspective.
</P>
<P>
With an emphasis on good engineering, the book promotes modularity
and division of labour - in particular, the use of libraries. It 
introduces the GF Resource Grammar Library, which currently addresses 
16 languages. This number is constantly growing due to contributions 
from the international GF community. The library makes it painless to 
build applications and to port them to new languages. The book 
introduces a wide range of such applications, which run on platforms 
ranging from web servers to mobile phones. But the book also gives 
guidance for those readers who want to understand the underlying 
linguistics and implement resource grammars for new languages.
</P>
<P>
The book starts with a hands-on tutorial, continues with a selection 
of advanced topics, and ends with a complete reference manual 
of GF. Requiring very little background knowledge, it is accessible 
for second-year students that have experience with computers and an 
interest for languages. At the same time, its novel and advanced 
material makes it interesting for senior researchers in computer science, 
linguistics, and related fields.
