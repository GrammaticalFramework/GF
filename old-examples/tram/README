Björn Bringert's tram grammars (user side, without place names)
implemented as an example of lib/resource/abstract/Multimodal.

For documentation of the original system, see 

  http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~bringert/gf/tramdemo.html

To try, do in gf

  i TramEng.gf
  gr | l -tr | p

Clicks appear as coordinates on the right of the semicolon.
This works in eight languages.

Notice that the compilation of the grammars uses precompiled 
resources, located in 

  GF/lib/

To produce them, use 'make' and 'make install' in GF/lib/resource-1.0.
You moreover have to set your GF_LIB_PATH to point to your GF/lib/.

The grammar in ExTramI.gfe compiles, but does not give the same grammar 
as TramI.gf.
