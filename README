# Grammatical Framework (GF)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/GrammaticalFramework/GF.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/GrammaticalFramework/GF)

The Grammatical Framework is a grammar formalism based on type theory.
It consists of:

- a special-purpose programming language
- a compiler of the language
- a generic grammar processor

The compiler reads GF grammars from user-provided files, and the
generic grammar processor performs various tasks with the grammars:

- generation
- parsing
- translation
- type checking
- computation
- paraphrasing
- random generation
- syntax editing

GF particularly addresses four aspects of grammars:

- multilinguality (parallel grammars for different languages)
- semantics (semantic conditions of well-formedness, semantic properties of expressions)
- grammar engineering (modularity, abstractions, libraries)
- embeddability in programs written in other languages (C, C++, Haskell, Java, JavaScript)
